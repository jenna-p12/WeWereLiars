        <h1>Welcome to Sinclair Island</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">"We are Sinclairs. No one is needy. No one is wrong" (Lockhart 16).</p>
        <div class="intro">
            <p>Sinclair Island looks perfect from a distance.</p>
            <p>Blue water, white sand, and elegant houses that have been passed down through generations.</p>
            <p>The Sinclairs were taught to smile, to shine, to never let their weaknesses show.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>But Cadence's memories don't shine, they disappear and fracture.</p>
            <p>They leave behind sharp, scattered, aching pieces.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This website allows you to explore the island the way Cadence remembers it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In fragments</li>
                <li>In flashes</li>
                <li>In truths that are hidden inside lies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Try to understand what happened the summer that everything burned.</p>

        <div class="theme-box">
            <h3><span class="color-symbol blue-grey"></span>Color and Symbolism</h3>
            <p><strong>Blue/Grey:</strong> Represents Cadence's emotional state of confusion and sadness. The blue is cloudy which mirrors her cloudy mind after the fire/accident. This symbolizes her struggle with memory and the truth.</p>
            <p><strong><span class="color-symbol white-symbol"></span>White:</strong> Represents the Sinclair family image, perfection, and their spoiled private island. This white exterior hides the dark secrets and represents the family's obsession with perfect appearances over reality.</p>
            <p><strong><span class="color-symbol dark"></span>Dark Tones:</strong> Represents the hidden truth and the dark reality beneath the beautiful surface of Sinclair Island.</p>
            <p><em>E. Lockhart uses color symbolism throughout the novel to reinforce themes of deception, privilege, and memory loss.</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="theme-box">
            <h3>Memory & Trauma</h3>
            <p>Cadence's narration is broken on purpose. Her missing memories represent how trauma can bury truths that are too painful to face. The book reads like a puzzle, or a shattered mirror which is how her mind works. Readers are to experience the same confusion and disorientation that Cady feels.</p>
            <p><em>" 'Because I have headaches, because I can't remember my accident, I can't handle the idea that Clairmont burned down?' " (Lockhart 203).</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="theme-box">
            <h3>Privilege and Class</h3>
            <p>Beechwood Island is beautiful; however the Sinclair legacy is rotten underneath. Their wealth creates the pressure to appear perfect, the denial of their flaws, silence around conflict, and emotional manipulation.</p>
            <p>Cadence, Gat, and the other Liars see how toxic the family's values are, chasing inheritance and that Sinclairs are always to be 'right' even if it hurts another.</p>
            <p><em>"We are Sinclairs. No one is needy. No one is wrong" (Lockhart 16).</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="theme-box">
            <h3>Denial and Truth</h3>
            <p>The adults' refusal to address conflict causes their kids to take an action that is irreversible. Their fights over money and legacy intensify into something the Liars believe only a grand gesture can solve. </p>
            <p>The fire becomes a symbol of cleansing, but also devastation. Denial burns everything.</p>
            <p><em>" 'And angrier, every time. Screaming at each other. Staggering around the lawn. Granddad did nothing but fuel them. We watched them quarrel over Gran's things and the art that hung in Clairmont—but real estate and money most of all' " (Lockhart 170).</em></p>
            <p><em>"They no longer had the glue of Gran keeping them together, and they fought over their memories, her jewelry, the clothes in her closet, her shoes, even. These affairs had not been settled in October" (Lockhart 171-172).</em></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="theme-box">
            <h3>Love & Loyalty</h3>
            <p>The Liars are bounded by love. Their loyalty drives the plot, making them brave, idealistic, and reckless.</p>
            <p>They want to fix everything wrong with the Sinclairs, but the cost is high.</p>
            <p><em>"What if we could stop being different colors, different backgrounds, and just be in love?" (Lockhart 197).</em></p>
