        <h1>Welcome to Sinclair Island</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">"We are Sinclairs. No one is needy. No one is wrong" (Lockhart 16).</p>
        <div class="intro">
            <p>Sinclair Island looks perfect from a distance.</p>
            <p>Blue water, white sand, and elegant houses that have been passed down through generations.</p>
            <p>The Sinclairs were taught to smile, to shine, to never let their weaknesses show.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>But Cadence's memories don't shine, they disappear and fracture.</p>
            <p>They leave behhind sharp, scattered, aching pieces.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>This website allows you to explore the island the way Cadence remembers it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In fragments</li>
                <li>In flashes</li>
                <li>In truths that are hidden inside lies</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Try to understand what happened the summer that everything burned.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem; font-style: italic; color: #536878;">Hover over the island images below to reveal their secrets...</p>

                <div class="detail">
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong>This motto isn't pride, it's denial. It is a rule that keeps the Sinclairs elegant on the outside while they break inside. It shows the family's obession with image, even when it destroys them.</p>

                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong>The fire didn't just destroy Clairmont, it erased the truth. Or maybe hid it. Cadence's missing memories are tied to this place, this night, this flame, showing how trauma can hide what we cannot face.</p>

It hurts,” I say—and I realize tears are running down my face, though I'm not sobbing. “It makes it hard to be alive, some days.

                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Cadence's headaches are both physical and emotional symptoms of her trauma. They block her memories of the fire, distort her perception, and show the intense suffering and self-blame that she experiences. Her pain explains why her narration is fragmented, highlighting how truma can overwhelm memory and reality.</p>

                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Cadence remembering the death of her grandfather's dogs hints at the fire's real consequences of living things getting burned, not just objects.

            <h3><span class="color-symbol blue-grey"></span>Color and Symbolism</h3>
            <p><strong>Blue/Grey:</strong> Represents Cadence's emotional state of confusion and sadness. The cloudy blue mirrors her cloudy mind after the accident, symbolizing her struggle with memory and truth.</p>
            <p><strong><span class="color-symbol white-symbol"></span>White:</strong> Symbolizes the Sinclair family's image of perfection and their pristine private island. This white facade hides the darker secrets and represents the family's obsession with appearances over reality.</p>
            <p><strong><span class="color-symbol pastel"></span>Bright Pastels:</strong> Used in flashbacks to represent the carefree, luxurious life the family presents. These vibrant colors create a stark contrast to the underlying emotional pain and tragedy.</p>
            <p><strong><span class="color-symbol dark"></span>Dark Tones:</strong> Represent the hidden truth and the darker reality beneath the beautiful surface of Sinclair Island.</p>
            <p><em>E. Lockhart uses this color symbolism throughout the novel to reinforce themes of deception, privilege, and memory loss.</em></p>

            <h3>Memory and Unreliable Narration</h3>
